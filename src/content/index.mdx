# What is Roamify API?

Welcome to Roamify API documentation. Here you will find all the information you need to get started with our services.

Our API is a RESTful API that allows you to integrate Roamify services into your application. With Roamify API, you can buy eSIMs, check your balance, and more.

Currently, we support the following services:

- [Authentication](/authentication)
- [eSIMs](/esims/overview)
- [Gift Cards](/gift-cards/overview)
- [Health Check](/health)

We are constantly working on adding more services to our API. If you have any questions or need help, please contact us at [here](https://partner.getroamify.com/sign-up).
