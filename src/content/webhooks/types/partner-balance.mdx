<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    Before you start using the partner balance event webhook, you need to configure your webhook URL in the Roamify dashboard. This URL will be used to receive notifications about eSIM status changes.
</Callout>

## Overview
The Partner Balance Event webhook sends notifications about changes in your partner account balance. This allows you to monitor your account balance in real-time and track transactions that affect your balance.

The `event_type` for these events will be either
-`low_balance`: this event is triggered when your balance falls below the configured threshold, allowing you to take action to replenish your balance.
-`insufficient_balance`: this event is triggered when a transaction is attempted that exceeds your current balance, indicating that the balance is insufficient to cover the transaction.
-`top_up`: this event is triggered when you add funds to your partner account, allowing you to track when your balance is replenished.

The event will be triggered when:
- Your balance falls below the configured threshold.
- 75% of the threshold is reached, which can be used to proactively manage your balance.
- 50% of the threshold is reached, allowing you to take action before reaching the critical low balance.
- 25% of the threshold is reached, which can be useful for early warnings.
- A transaction is attempted that exceeds your current balance, resulting in an insufficient balance event.
- Funds are added to your partner account, resulting in a top-up event.

## Event Payload
The webhook payload contains the following fields:

- `event_category`: The category of event. For partner events, this will be `partner`.
- `event_type`: The type of event. For partner balance events, this will be any of `low_balance` or `insufficient_balance` or `top_up`.
- `data`: The data object containing the partner balance information, which includes:
    - `timestamp`: The time when the event was triggered, in unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch).
    - `balance`: The currency balance amount.
    - `threshold`: The threshold amount that triggered the event, if applicable.
    - `threshold_percentage`: The percentage of the threshold relative to the total balance, if applicable.
    - `currency`: The currency of the balance, in ISO 4217 format (e.g., USD, EUR).

### Example Payload
Here is an example of the Partner Balance Event webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event_type": "low_balance",
  "event_category": "partner",
  "data": {
      "timestamp": 1673123456,
      "balance": 50.00,
      "threshold": 100.00,
      "threshold_percentage": 50,
      "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

## Mandatory Response
You must respond with a 200 OK status code to acknowledge receipt of the webhook. We recommend responding quickly (within 3 seconds) to avoid overloading Roamify's webhook server.
We recommend you send response first and then process the webhook data in the background to ensure that you do not miss any webhook events due to processing delays.

### Response Example
```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "status": "success"
}
```
