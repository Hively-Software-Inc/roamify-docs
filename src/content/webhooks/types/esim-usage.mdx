## Overview
The eSIM Usage Event webhook sends notifications about eSIM data usage at configurable intervals. This allows you to monitor data consumption and take appropriate actions based on usage patterns.

The event will be triggered for every activated eSIM every 4 hours, and it will also be triggered when data usage reaches the following thresholds:
- 25% of the total data allocation
- 50% of the total data allocation
- 75% of the total data allocation
- 90% of the total data allocation
- 100% of the total data allocation


## Event Payload
The webhook payload contains the following fields:

- `event_category`: The category of event. For esim events, this will be `esim`.
- `event_type`: The type of event. For esim usage events, this will be `usage`.
- `data`: The data object containing the eSIM usage information, which includes:
    - `timestamp`: The time when the event was triggered, in unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch).
    - `iccid`: The Integrated Circuit Card Identifier of the eSIM.
    - `esim_id`: The unique identifier of the eSIM (UUID format).
    - `reference_id`: A custom referenceId provided by the user when creating the order if applicable.
    - `start`: The start time of the usage period, in unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch).
    - `end`: The end time of the usage period, in unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch).
    - `status`: The status of the eSIM usage event. Possible values include:
    - `NEW`: The eSIM is newly generated and not yet installed.
    - `INSTALLED`: The eSIM has been installed on a device.
    - `ACTIVATED`: The eSIM has been activated and is currently in use.
    - `INACTIVE`: The eSIM is inactive and not currently in use.
    - `REVOKED`: The eSIM has been revoked and is no longer valid.
    - `EXPIRED`: The eSIM has expired and is no longer valid.
    - `UNKNOWN`: The status of the eSIM is unknown or not specified.
    - `package_id`: The unique identifier of the eSIM package.
    - `package_name`: The name of the eSIM package.
    - `data_units`: The units used for data allocation, typically "MB" (megabytes).
    - `voice_units`: The units used for voice allocation, typically "minutes".
    - `sms_units`: The units used for SMS allocation, typically "sms".
    - `usage_data`: Object containing usage data, which includes:
    - `isUnlimited`: Indicates whether the data allocation is unlimited (true/false).
    - `allowed_data`: The total data allocation in megabytes (MB).
    - `remaining_data`: The remaining data allocation in megabytes (MB).
    - `allowed_sms`: The total SMS allocation.
    - `remaining_sms`: The remaining SMS allocation.
    - `allowed_voice`: The total voice allocation in minutes.
    - `remaining_voice`: The remaining voice allocation in minutes.
    - `usage_list`: An array of usage records, each containing:
    - `date`: The date of the usage record in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).
    - `data_used`: The amount of data used in megabytes (MB).
    - `location`: The location where the usage occurred, represented as a string (e.g., "Afghanistan").
